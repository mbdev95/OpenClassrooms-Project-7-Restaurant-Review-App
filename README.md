# Restaurant Review Locator

## Introduction
For my seventh project of the OpenClassrooms Front-End developer course I created a restaurant review locator app using React, CSS and REST APIs.

Secondarily, another goal was to learn how to import data using REST APIs, and then render the imported data to the page depending on events instantiated by the user.  This project taught me the importance of using Javascript libraries and REST APIs to increase the capablities of the functionality of my apps.

The interface created starts with a parent component, which then holds the JSX of child components, and further child components.  In my app the parent component called App holds the JSX from the Header, Footer, and Main components.  The main component contains the Map and Restaurants components.  The Restaurants component holds the JSX from the Filter and RestaurantList components.  Thus, in my application
